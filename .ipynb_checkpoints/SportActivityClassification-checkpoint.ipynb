One important thing to consider is that logistic regression outperforms neural network when training data is less and features are large, since neural networks need large training data. Of course there is a strike also for neural networks since they can support non-linear solutions where for example logistic regression can not. \n",
    "Talking about time consumption, KNN is comparatively slower than other competitors like logistic regression and decision trees, but it supports non-linear solutions too. One major downgrade is that, KNN can only output the labels. Lukily, KNN requires less data to achieve a sufficient accuracy respect to neural networks, but it needs lot of hyperparameter tuning compared to KNN.\n",
    "Finally, let's spend some workd about decision trees. In general, they handle colinearity better, but can not derive the significance of features, hence they are better for a categorical evaluation. Respect to KNN, decision tree supports automatic feature interaction, and it is faster due to KNN’s expensive real time execution. Decision trees perform better when there is a large set of categorical values in the training data. In comparison to neural networks, decision trees are better suited when the scenario demands an explanation over the decision, but when there is sufficient training data, neural networks outperfomr drastically decision trees."
